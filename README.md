# logistic_regression_classification
A logistic regression model was fit using baseline data and the predictors selected from first step for classification between patients with at least 5 new lesions and less than five lesions over 2 years. To jointly evaluate the prediction performance, the following cross-validation strategy was applied: The samples were randomly divided into one training set (80% of samples) to train the model and one test set (20% of samples) used for prediction performance assessment. This process was repeated for 10 random partitions of the samples into training and test sets. The final prediction accuracy was calculated as the percentage of correctly classified samples across the 10 cross-validation rounds.
